#lexov

lexov is a project to learn about rendering procedurally generated voxel terrains with C++11 and modern OpenGL.

Here are some images of the engine rendering the procedurally generated floating rock from [this wonderful codeflow article](http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/dec/09/minecraft-like-rendering-experiments-in-opengl-4/). I've modified the algorithm for generating the rock to distribute the terrain an arbitrary number of chunks.
